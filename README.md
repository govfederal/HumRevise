### Updated Essay Draft Using Real Quotes

#### Introduction

Trust is an important part of human relationships because it helps people survive, connect, and grow. In Mark Smith’s novel *The Road to Winter*, trust is tested as characters try to survive after society collapses. The way Finn learns who to trust reminded me of times in my own life when I had to take risks in trusting others. The novel shows me that even though trust can be difficult, it is necessary for survival and for building real relationships.

#### Body Paragraph 1 (Connecting to Myself)

In *The Road to Winter*, trust feels both fragile and essential—something I relate to deeply when forming meaningful relationships. Early in the novel, Finn wonders, *“how do I know I can trust her?”* (p. 23), expressing his fear that Rose might not be who she claims. ([Studocu][1]) This resonates with me because I, too, have hesitated to open up—unsure if someone will reciprocate or betray my vulnerability. But the risk of trusting is often outweighed by the connection it brings. As the story progresses, Finn comes to rely on others—notably when he admits, *“I never thought there’d be someone else on my side – someone I’d want to fight for.”* (p. 98), ([Studocu][1]) capturing how trust transforms into loyalty and mutual support. This mirrors how I’ve learned to trust people—it may feel scary, but it leads to stronger bonds.

#### Body Paragraph 2 (Connecting to the World)

The theme of trust in *The Road to Winter* also mirrors real-world crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, when communities had to depend on each other amidst widespread fear. Trust was scarce, and doubts about who to believe or rely on were common. Finn’s guarded attitude—*“how do I know I can trust her?”* (p. 23)—reflects that same hesitation we experienced when deciding whether to trust public health advice, news sources, or even our neighbors. ([Studocu][1]) People had to weigh the risks of believing and working together against a backdrop of uncertainty. Just like Finn eventually finds someone worth trusting, we too learned that, during crisis, rebuilding trust—even cautiously—is vital for survival and collective resilience.

#### Conclusion

Mark Smith’s *The Road to Winter* shows us that trust, though risky, is key to survival and connection—whether in a post-apocalyptic world or during real crises like the pandemic. Finn’s journey from fear (*"how do I know I can trust her?"*, p. 23) to finding someone worth fighting for (*“I never thought there’d be someone else on my side…”*, p. 98) parallels the path many of us took: learning that even amid uncertainty, trust remains a cornerstone of human resilience.
